# My solution of the Scrimba's JavaScript Loader Challenge

Here's me trying to solve the Scrimba's JavaScript Loader challenge. 

I added some styling to the project. 

I Wrote about 37 lines of JS code as per functionality.

I can always get better at making my codes DRY.

## JS Concepts covered

1. For loops
2. AddEventListener() method
3. SetInterval() method
4. Transform : rotate property(CSS)
